                Hello! I'm Mahmoud Khalil, I'm currently a student in the Case Western University bootcamp in hopes that I will successfully gain experience
                to begin my coding career. My past job experiences consist of working as a retailer for about 1 year then continuing as a mechanic. I graduated 
                from an early college program when I was in highschool in 2020. When graduating I received my high school diploma as well as my associates degree.
                A couple of my favorite things to do is to travel and be around family.
            </p>
